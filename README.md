# From Movie to Masterpiece: Top Classical Music in Cinema

A data-driven story that explores the trends and patterns of classic music used in movie soundtracks.

## Data

- Data scraped in October 2019 from [Naxos Music Library](https://t.me/thecvdbot) using [this Python Script](https://www.naxos.com/musicinmovies.asp)

- Data is derived from Naxos resources and IMDB.

- Data was imported into Excel, with four columns: Movie Title, Movie Year, Piece Title, Piece Composer

- NOTE: Data is not complete. Would recommend a direct scrape from IMDB for any further research.

## Research Questions

After seeing the CSV worksheet, I now had a basis for creating my research questions:
1. What are the top pieces played in the movies?
2. When were the most popular periods in modern history to use classical music in movies?
3. Who are the most common composers and are they all represented in the top ten pieces?
4. Were the majority of the composers from a certain era of music? (Baroque, Classical, etc)
5. Do the scenes that classical music appears in correspond to particular life events?
6. What are the top genres that classical music appears in?


## Design Question and Considerations

Can exploring classical music in movies help advance music appreciation during a time where classical music seems to be in decline?

- Music stimulates creativity in different parts of the brain
- The arts contribute to an open-minded culture
- Movies make music relatable
- Interest in classical music is declining online, and also in more traditional platforms such as performance attendance.


## Concept Statement

This interactive, data-driven story explores the trends and patterns of the top classical music used in movie soundtracks. It helps familiarize an audience of pop culture fans with the staples of classical music repertoire and establishes a lasting connection with the arts and culture.

## Code

This project was first designed in Adobe XD, and then built using HTML, CSS and D3.js. Pure Javascript was used for building the "Create Your Own Soundtrack" interactive element. Adobe Illustrator was used for several visualizations, and Photoshop was used for GIF creation.

## Blog

A weekly blog was kept during the building process to document the progress/set backs of coding and visualizing, which can be accessed [here](https://www.mackmiller.design/capstone-journal).
